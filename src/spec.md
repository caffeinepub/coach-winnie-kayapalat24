# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Member ID easy for coaches to find and share by exposing it prominently in the coach UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the coach-facing Member Profile page header to display a clearly labeled “Member ID” with the member profile `id` value near the top (visible without scrolling on typical mobile viewports).
- Add a one-tap “Copy” action next to the Member ID on the Member Profile page, copying the exact ID string and showing an English confirmation (e.g., “Copied”).
- Update the coach-facing Members list cards to display “Member ID” with the member’s `id` value, ensuring the layout remains readable (truncate/wrap if needed).

**User-visible outcome:** Coaches can see each member’s ID on both the members list and the member profile page, and can copy the ID with one tap to share it.
